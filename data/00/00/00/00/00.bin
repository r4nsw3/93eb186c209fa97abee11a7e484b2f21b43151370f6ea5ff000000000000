  |   Use your alchemic abilities to escape the island in this brutally     |
  |   challenging 2D action-platformer with no checkpoints. You'll get      |
  |   better... eventually.                                                 |

  |   Dead Cells puts you in control of a failed alchemic experiment        |
  |   trying to figure out what's happening on a sprawling, ever-changing   |
  |   and seemingly cursed Island. Tough but fair combat, responsive        |
  |   controls, challenging foes, permadeath and of course, the emergency   |
  |   panic roll to get you out of trouble, make for a demanding,           |
  |   visceral and cathartic action game.                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Experience a Roguevania, mixing an interconnected world, branching    |
  |   paths and unlockable skills with the constant adrenaline-pumping      |
  |   threat of permadeath. No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final   |
  |   boss in one go, or you try again. However, you keep some of your      |
  |   progress for successive runs; new paths you've unlocked, access to    |
  |   new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons.                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Speaking of weapons, Dead Cells features a plethora of ways to slay   |
  |   your enemies. A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells,   |
  |   but also whips, grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique    |
  |   twist. Plus, mutations and scrolls allow you to build and customize   |
  |   your character differently with each and every run.                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   At the end of the day though, it's YOUR skills as a player that       |
  |   matter most! Roguelites are about constantly sharpening your          |
  |   skills, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in   |
  |   the park. Patience, you'll get better!... eventually.                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   RogueVania: The progressive exploration of an interconnected world,   |
  |   with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping     |
  |   threat of permadeath.                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   2D Souls-lite Action: Tough but fair combat, the iconic dodge roll,   |
  |   more than 90 weapons and spells with unique gameplay... The           |
  |   unforgiving action wed to the absence of any kind of safety net       |
  |   makes for an adrenalin pumping ride each and every run.               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Nonlinear progression: Sewers, Ossuary or Ramparts? Once unlocked,    |
  |   special permanent abilities allow you to access new paths to reach    |
  |   your objective. Opt for the path that suits your current build,       |
  |   your play style, or just your mood.                                   |
